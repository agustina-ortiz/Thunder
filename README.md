## Tools

 - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): With the Firebase Realtime Database I was able to store and sync orders with my users in real time.
 - [Sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/): This library allows me to show custom alerts instead of the browser alerts.
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): With this framework I designed the cards that contain the products, improving the aesthetics of the application.
